Description: server virtualization solution - quota tools
 OpenVZ is an Operating System-level server virtualization solution, built
 on Linux. OpenVZ creates isolated, secure virtual private servers on a single
 physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that
 applications do not conflict. Each VPS performs and executes exactly like a
 stand-alone server; VPSs can be rebooted independently and have root access,
 users, IP addresses, memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries
 and configuration files.
 .
 This package contain the control tool to manipulate quota for virtual servers.
